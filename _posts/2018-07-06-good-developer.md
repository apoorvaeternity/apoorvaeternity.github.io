A lot of time this question pops up in our mind `How to become a good developer?`. I am not writing a complete step-by-step guide to become a good developer but there are certain traits that I found in good developers and I would like to share them. So here it is based on my experiences.

- **They know what they are doing**- Every change made to source code is made for a reason. They avoid any irrelevant additions to the codebase.

- **They follow official documentation**- Official documentation of languages, frameworks, libraries etc. is followed before moving on to sites like StackOverflow, YouTube etc.

- **They follow coding style and design patterns**- For every language or framework used a set coding style and design pattern is followed.

- **They write tests**- Test suites are used and tests are written for the code so that errors can easily be encountered in the code if anything breaks.

- **They comment their code well**- Often the comments are larger than the code itself.

- **They create a proper documentation**- For every feature addition, the documentation is also updated immediately.

- **They know how to act on error messages**- For every error encountered the traceback or error is read to find the reason of for it.

- **They know how to Google**- Proper search terms lead to proper solutions.

- **They are enthusiastic**- Without this development would be a pain.

- **They have good communication skills**- Like in every field involving people, communication is crucial for development.

- **They are helpful and friendly**- They try to help people working on other issues and features and are also friendly.


Coming back to my GSoC project-<br>
Last week my [pull request](https://github.com/weecology/retrieverdash/pull/10) that adds the test for the dashboard script got merged. We have also zipped the data being used for test. Currently my [pull request](https://github.com/weecology/retrieverdash/pull/12)  that adds the dashboard is under review.
