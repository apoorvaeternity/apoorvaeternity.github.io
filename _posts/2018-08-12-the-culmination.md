The GSoC'18 coding period is about to culminate. So now it's time to have a look at what I have been able to achieve in the past three months. My project was divided into two major parts.

* The helper script
  * I wrote a script that checks the installation of all the datasets and creates a log file and also generates HTML   files showing side by side diffs in the tables of a dataset if there is any change.

* The dashboard
  * I have created a dashboard using Django where users and maintainers can see the status of datasets i.e. whether a particular dataset is installing or not and side by side diffs in the tables of a dataset in case of change.


This is what I had mentioned in my proposal and I have been able to deliver it. Thanks to my mentors Ethan White and Henry Senyondo for guiding me with each and every aspect of the project. The completion of the project would not have been possible without their guidance.

Here's a link to the list of commits that I made:

Participating in Google Summer of Code was a great experience. Though GSoC is coming to an end, my contributions to the project won't. I will continue with my efforts in making improvements. After three months I can say that I am a better developer, a better tester and a better debugger than I was three months back. 

Bye for now. Stay tuned.
