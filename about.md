I am Apoorva Pandey. A 3rd year student of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science.<br>
I am a tech enthusiast. I like to create things that make life easier and coding is the easiest way to do it as you just need a laptop for that. You can sit anywhere and create the next cool thing.<br>

Apart from coding I like to eat all kinds of food, play video games, listen to good music and sing.
